# Django Installation and Setup Guide (Offline)

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and running this scripts on your local PC.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): (version 3.6 or higher).
- pip (Python package manager - Usually comes with Python)

## Installation Steps

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Navigate to the directory where you created your virtual environment and activate it. Run the following command:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Django**: Once your virtual environment is activated, use pip to install Django. Run the following command:
   ```
   pip install django
   ```

## Running the Django Scripts

Now that you have Django installed, you can now run the Django scripts on your local PC.

1. **Install the project dependencies**: In your terminal, run the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the directory of the Django project:
   ```
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**: Start the Django development server by running the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. **Access the Local Development Server**: Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/` to view the Django project.
   
5. **Access the admin dashboard**: Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` to access your admin interface.
